            <b>Nitrogen (N)</b> is essential for root development, tillering, early
            flowering, and ripening. It is especially deficient in sandy soils
            with low organic matter contents, in very acid soils and in
            alkaline soils.
            P deficient plants are stunted, tillering is reduced, the leaves often have a
            blackish green color, and maturity is delayed.

      <h3>How much nutrients does the crop need?</h3>
      <p class="ion-text-justify">
        In the previous lessons we explained that the crop needs nutrients to
        grow and mature normally.
      </p>
      <p class="ion-text-justify">
        IThe rice crop needs the following uptake of N, P and K to produce 1
        ton of grain per hectare:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nitrogen (N):15-20 kg</li>
        <li>Phosphorous (P): 2-3 kg</li>
        <li>Potassium (K): 15-20 kg (If all straw remains in the field and is
          evenly distributed, K requirements can be reduced to 3-5 kg/ha per
          ton of grain yield.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>How much fertilizer do you need to apply?</h3>
      <p class="ion-text-justify">
        In every field, you will get a certain grain yield even if you donâ€™t
        apply any fertilizer. The nutrients for this yield are supplied by the
        soil. If you want to increase the yield, it is necessary to apply
        fertilizers.
      </p>
      <p class="ion-text-justify">
        However, it is very important to understand that of all the fertilizer
        you apply on the field, the crop can only take up a fraction.
      </p>
      <p class="ion-text-justify">
        For nitrogen, for example, even with good management about half
        the applied fertilizer (50%) is lost. We said above that the plants
        need to take up 15 to 20 kg of nitrogen per hectare to produce 1 ton
        of grain. This means we have to apply twice as much fertilizer, or 30
        to 40 kg of N per hectare, to produce an extra ton of grain!
